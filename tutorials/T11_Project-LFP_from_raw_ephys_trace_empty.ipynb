    "You are provided with a raw extracellular recording from the hippocampus of a awake behaving rat. The trace has been recorded with a silicon probe (32 channel) and you will be analyzing the signal from a single channel (the probe delivers in total 32 of such recordings). The signal contains the local field potential (LFP) as well as spiking signals. Since both occur at different frequencies, it is possible to separate them through appropriate signal filtering using spectral analysis. Your task is to extract frequency content of the LFP from the raw trace. The frequency content of the LFP trace can then be further analyzed and be linked to specific behaviors. \n",

The frequency range of interest ranges from 0 to 100 Hz. Characterize which frequencies are contained in the recording, and whether these signals change over time. Which frequencies show prominent dynamics during the recording period, i.e., which frequencies show dynamics changes in spectral power over time? \n",
